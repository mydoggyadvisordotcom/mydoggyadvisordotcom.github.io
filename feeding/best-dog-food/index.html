    <h2>Does it really matter what dog food?</h2>
    <p>It may seem like dog food is just, well, dog food. <strong>They are not all the same and not created for the same
        type of dogs.</strong> The quality of animal food products varies greatly from one brand to another; some brands
        have stronger advertisements and some are hardly known for most of the dog owners. It can be quite hard to
        determine
        what the best type of dog food is for your furry friend.</p>

    <p>There are many high-quality dog food options available on the market, but there are also those that cut corners
        by bulking up their products with cheap unhealthy fillers and artificial additives. These foods are not
        regulated
        in the same way as human foods are, so <strong>if you want to find a healthy and quality product, you'll have to
            do
            some digging.</strong></p>

    <p>The quality of <strong>your dog's diet is directly related to its health</strong>, so you need to do your
        research
        to find what’s best for your dog. Since every dog is unique, <strong>you need to understand your dog's
            nutritional
            requirements</strong> and have some knowledge of how to read a pet food label.</p>

    <p class="note">If you’re thinking about changing your dog’s diet, <strong>it’s a good idea to consult with your
        veterinarian</strong> before doing so.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h2>What to look for in dog food?</h2>

    <p>First, you should <strong>read the ingredient list</strong> just as you’d do with human food. This gives you an
        idea of general composition and focus of the dog food. The list typically contains a lot of ingredients and the
        <strong>first three to five are the most critical</strong> to understand the basic composition of the product.
        This will help you determine if the formula is vegetable-based with products like corn and rice or meat-based
        with
        chicken, fish, or lamb. <strong>While each dog is different, they generally do best on a protein-rich,
            meat-based
            diet.</strong></p>

    <p>Next, analyze what type of meat is within. <strong>Look for brands that specifically name the type of meat
        product</strong>. The label should say specifically, beef, chicken, or lamb. Dog foods stating only meat, bone
        meal, or meat by-products could come from any animal; similarly, “poultry meal” signals any kind of bird.</p>

    <p>It’s worth to study the whole list of ingredients, as this will also highlight some of what you want to avoid.
        <strong>Avoid dog food that includes dyes</strong> (dogs don’t worry too much about the color of their food),
        <strong>sugar and high salt</strong> (typically used as preservatives), and other solvents. You may find solvent
        and preservative ingredients that you have never heard about, so you might want to check what those actually
        are.
        The main ones to <strong>avoid</strong> are <strong>propylene glycol, BHA, BHT and ethoxyquin</strong>.</p>

    <h2>How do I know what dog food is best for my dog?</h2>
    <p><strong>The field of dog food is immensely wide</strong> and so are your options. You’ve have food for puppies and senior dogs, dry food and wet food, grain-free food, food for small dogs, food for large dogs, dog food for allergies, and dog food for sensitive stomach.</p>
    <p>This short guide hopefully helps you to <strong>understand why certain dogs need different food</strong> and how to make it easier to navigate through these options to find the best dog food for your pet.</p>

    <h3>Is puppy dog food necessary?</h3>
    <p>Puppies are at the age when they develop their bone structure. Therefore, <strong>choosing the best food for your puppy is one of the most important decisions</strong> you can make. Adult dog food contains too much calcium which negatively influences the bone development of the growing puppy and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1604770">it can lead to develop hip and elbow dysplasia</a>.</p>
</article>

<article class="section">
    <h3>What is better dry or wet dog food?</h3>
    <p><strong>Dry dog food</strong> (or kibble) is typically <strong>a better investment</strong>, as you get more nutrition and less water compare to wet or canned dog food. One other benefit of dry food, is that the friction of <strong>chewing it can help keep your dog’s teeth and gums healthy</strong>.</p>
    <p>However, you can use your imagination. <strong>If you go with dry food, try topping</strong> it with a bit of canned food, some remaining food from home, or other toppers.</p>
</article>

<article class="section">
    <h3>Is grain free dog food better?</h3>
    <p>In general, the best <strong>grain-free dog foods contain more protein</strong> than their competitors because grain is replaced by potato and legumes that are rich protein. <strong>However</strong>, plant protein <strong>can be deficient in certain essential amino acids</strong> and they can upset the delicate amino acid balance of the food.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Important alert</strong>: There’s recently been worry over grain-free dog food: the FDA is investigating <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/news-events/fda-investigation-potential-link-between-certain-diets-and-canine-dilated-cardiomyopathy">a potential link between grain-free diet and heart disease</a> in dogs. Due to this, many dog owners are looking for dog foods that contain grain.</p>
</article>

<article class="section">
    <h3>How is senior dog food different?</h3>
    <p><strong>An older dog needs more protein in its diet than a younger one</strong>. That’s because seniors need to replace wasting muscle mass as they age. However, if your older dog is healthy and eating a quality, protein rich, balanced diet, there’s no real reason to switch to a senior dog food.</p>
    <p class="note">A dog food rich in meat-based protein will not strain a healthy, older dog’s kidneys. However, <strong>if your dog has already been diagnosed with kidney disease, be sure to ask your vet</strong> about prescribing an appropriate diet.</p>
</article>

<article class="section">
    <h3>What do you feed a dog with food allergies?</h3>
    <p><strong>There are foods designed with fewer ingredients</strong> so they can help to pin down the specific ingredient to which your dog may be allergic.</p>
    <p><strong>In more serious cases veterinarians can prescribe hypoallergenic dog foods</strong>. These are usually made to help your dog ingest the food, so they’re less likely to experience an allergic reaction.</p>
</article>

<article class="section">
    <h3>What food is easy on a dog's stomach?</h3>
    <p>Some digestive problems can be controlled with a simple change in diet, others can be caused by something more serious. <strong>Gastrointestinal dog foods are special purpose diets made for dogs suffering from digestive problems</strong>. It’s like limited ingredient food and they also include ingredients specifically designed to support digestion.</p>
</article>

<article class="section">
    <h3>Do small dogs need small dog food?</h3>
    <p>The best small breed dog foods are designed to provide balanced nutrition for dogs whose ideal adult weight is under 20 pounds. That’s because <strong>small dogs</strong> tend to <strong>benefit from food optimized for their higher rate of metabolism</strong> and their smaller physical size.</p>
    <p>However, a recent study found that <strong><a href="https://afbinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/206/small_dogs_large_kibble_8_10.pdf">every size dog preferred large kibble over small</a></strong> or medium sized pieces, so you don’t need to restrict your dog food selection to small kibble sizes.</p>
</article>

<article class="section">
    <h3>What is different about large breed dog food?</h3>
    <p>Choosing the best large breed dog food can make an enormous difference in the health of your dog, especially puppies. <strong>Dog foods</strong> designed <strong>for large dogs focus on bone development that’s necessary to support their weight</strong>. Feeding your dog with the  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1604770">wrong type of food could lead to permanent bone damage</a>, including a crippling form of hip dysplasia.</p>

<article class="section">
    <h3>What is the cheapest but best dog food?</h3>
    <p>It’s generally not a good idea to go for the cheapest dog food, but <strong>with research and lot of experiments it’s possible to find good dog food that’s 30% cheaper</strong> than the expensive alternative.</p>
</article>

<article class="section">
    <h3>Is organic dog food better?</h3>
    <p>With <strong>USDA organic label</strong>, your <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/organic/labeling">dog food is certified</a> to be free of antibiotics, synthetic hormones, toxic pesticides, and preservatives. Per the certification, <strong>its ingredients can’t be genetically engineered, grown in chemical fertilizer, or irradiated</strong>.</p>

                got her at 9 weeks old. We were planning to slowly migrate her over to this, but as soon as we mixed it
                into her food from the breeder, she wouldn't eat the old food anymore - she only wanted Orijen. She
                transitioned very easily and had no issues with her stool. This food is made of the very best
                ingredients - I couldn't wait to feed this to my pup. The kibble is also the right size for a puppy -
                it's smaller than regular adult size kibble which is another reason I think she likes it. It's got a
                moderately strong odor, but not bad. I fully plan to switch to an adult brand for Orijen as soon as my
                puppy comes of age. This is the highest quality dog food in the market - bar none.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Review</span>: Food is great! The girls love it. Margaux is 15 yrs old
                and still acts like a puppy! I also like that Nulo is one of the few dog foods that offers a puppy food.
                It is one of the reasons we selected it when we got Maize. Both girls are healthy and their coats, skin
                and teeth! I would recommend it to anyone.</p>

                research, I was unable to find anything as nutrient dense and high in the important stuff many others,
                even more expensive brands, skimp on. Don't take my word, do your own research and please let me know if
                you find a more nutritious dry food. This is the primary diet I feed my Boerboel, Molly.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Review</span>: I recently adopted a border collie beagle mix and we were
                unsure of her age at first I was told she was a puppy and went to go have her spayed and they said she’s
                more like three or four years old so I opted for the all life stages food. I heard about this dog food
                brand from dog food advisor. It was listed as the number one dry food for dogs and I can really see why.
                I’ve had my pup for about three months now and I’ve already seen a drastic change in her weight, her
                coat, and her overall health condition. The food smells great and my dog is extremely eager to eat it
                which makes me happy because she is a very finicky eater.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Review</span>: This is the first time I bought this brand of dry food,
                and the timing couldn't have been better. My large malamute/shepherd mix just had dental surgery and had
                a pretty sore mouth for days afterward. Because this food is very small kibble pieces, moistening it
                with water worked well and he was able to eat after 2 days. He has been a finicky eater but really
                seemed to enjoy this new food. My lab also likes the food. Good price, good quality.</p>
