    <h2>Does it really matter what dog food?</h2>
    <p>It may seem like dog food is just, well, dog food. <strong>They are not all the same and not created for the same type of dogs.</strong> The quality of animal food products varies greatly from one brand to another; some brands have stronger advertisements and some are hardly known for most dog owners. It can be quite hard to determine what the best type of dog food is for your furry friend.</p>
    <p>There are many high-quality dog food options available on the market, but there are also those that cut corners by bulking up their products with cheap unhealthy fillers and artificial additives. These foods are not regulated in the same way as human foods are, so <strong>if you want to find a healthy and quality product, you'll have to do some digging.</strong></p>
    <p>The quality of <strong>your dog's diet is directly related to its health</strong>, so you need to do your research to find what’s best for your dog. Since every dog is unique, <strong>you need to understand your dog's nutritional requirements</strong> and have some knowledge of how to read a pet food label.</p>
    <div class="important-box">
        <p>If you’re thinking about changing your dog’s diet, <strong>it’s a good idea to consult with your veterinarian</strong> before doing so.</p>
    </div>
</article>

<article>
    <h2>What to look for in dog food?</h2>
    <p>First, you should <strong>read the ingredient list</strong> just as you’d do with human food. This gives you an idea of the general composition and focus of the dog food. The list typically contains a lot of ingredients and the <strong>first three to five are the most critical</strong> to understand the basic composition of the product. This will help you determine if the formula is vegetable-based with products like corn and rice or meat-based with chicken, fish, or lamb. <strong>While each dog is different, they generally do best on a protein-rich, meat-based diet.</strong></p>
    <p>Next, analyze what type of meat is within. <strong>Look for brands that specifically name the type of meat product</strong>. The label should say specifically, beef, chicken, or lamb. Dog foods stating only meat, bone meal, or meat by-products could come from any animal; similarly, “poultry meal” signals any kind of bird.</p>
    <p>It’s worth studying the whole list of ingredients, as this will also highlight some of what you want to avoid. <strong>Avoid dog food that includes dyes</strong> (dogs don’t worry too much about the color of their food), <strong>sugar and high salt</strong> (typically used as preservatives), and other solvents. You may find solvent and preservative ingredients that you have never heard about, so you might want to check what those are. The main ones to <strong>avoid</strong> are <strong>propylene glycol, BHA, BHT, and ethoxyquin</strong>.</p>
    <p>Individual ingredients are important; however, you want to <strong>make sure that the food contains the right combination of the nutrients</strong> your dog needs to be healthy.</p>
    <div class="important-box">
        <p>To ensure you’re buying high-quality food, look for the <strong>nutrition adequacy statement</strong>, it’s considered as one of <strong>the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-health-literacy/pet-food-labels-general#Nutritional">most important aspects of a dog food label</a></strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How do I know what dog food is best for my dog?</h2>
    <p><strong>The field of dog food is immensely wide</strong> and so are your options. You have food for puppies and senior dogs, dry food and wet food, grain-free food, food for small dogs, food for large dogs, dog food for allergies, and dog food for sensitive stomachs.</p>
    <p>This short guide hopefully helps you to <strong>understand why certain dogs need different food</strong> and how to make it easier to navigate through these options to find the best dog food for your pet.</p>

    <h3>Is puppy dog food necessary?</h3>
    <p>Puppies are at the age when they develop their bone structure. Therefore, <strong>choosing the best food for your puppy is one of the most important decisions</strong> you can make. Adult dog food contains too much calcium which negatively influences the bone development of the growing puppy and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1604770">it can lead to developing hip and elbow dysplasia</a>.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h3>What is better dry or wet dog food?</h3>
    <p><strong>Dry dog food</strong> (or kibble) is typically <strong>a better investment</strong>, as you get more nutrition and less water compare to wet or canned dog food. One other benefit of dry food is that the friction of <strong>chewing it can help keep your dog’s teeth and gums healthy</strong>.</p>
    <p>However, you can use your imagination. <strong>If you go with dry food, try topping</strong> it with a bit of canned food, some remaining food from home, or other toppers.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h3>Is grain-free dog food better?</h3>
    <p>In general, the best <strong>grain-free dog foods contain more protein</strong> than their competitors because the grain is replaced by potatoes and legumes that are rich in protein. <strong>However</strong>, plant protein <strong>can be deficient in certain essential amino acids</strong> and they can upset the delicate amino acid balance of the food.</p>
    <div class="important-box">
        <p><strong>Important alert</strong>: There’s recently been worry over grain-free dog food: the FDA is investigating <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/news-events/fda-investigation-potential-link-between-certain-diets-and-canine-dilated-cardiomyopathy">a potential link between grain-free diet and heart disease</a> in dogs. Due to this, many dog owners are looking for dog foods that contain grain.</p>
    </div>
</article>

<article>
    <h3>How is senior dog food different?</h3>
    <p><strong>An older dog needs more protein in its diet than a younger one</strong>. That’s because seniors need to replace wasting muscle mass as they age. However, if your older dog is healthy and eating a quality, protein-rich, balanced diet, there’s no real reason to switch to a senior dog food.</p>
    <div class="important-box">
        <p>A dog food rich in meat-based protein will not strain a healthy, older dog’s kidneys. However, <strong>if your dog has already been diagnosed with kidney disease, be sure to ask your vet</strong> about prescribing an appropriate diet.</p>
    </div>
</article>

<article>
    <h3>What do you feed a dog with food allergies?</h3>
    <p><strong>There are foods designed with fewer ingredients</strong> so they can help to pin down the specific ingredient to which your dog may be allergic.</p>
    <p><strong>In more serious cases veterinarians can prescribe hypoallergenic dog foods</strong>. These are usually made to help your dog ingest the food, so they’re less likely to experience an allergic reaction.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h3>What food is easy on a dog's stomach?</h3>
    <p>Some digestive problems can be controlled with a simple change in diet, others can be caused by something more serious. <strong>Gastrointestinal dog foods are special-purpose diets made for dogs suffering from digestive problems</strong>. It’s like limited ingredient food and they also include ingredients specifically designed to support digestion.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h3>Do small dogs need small dog food?</h3>
    <p>The best small breed dog foods are designed to provide balanced nutrition for dogs whose ideal adult weight is under 20 pounds. That’s because <strong>small dogs</strong> tend to <strong>benefit from food optimized for their higher rate of metabolism</strong> and their smaller physical size.</p>
    <p>However, a recent study found that <strong><a href="https://afbinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/206/small_dogs_large_kibble_8_10.pdf">every size dog preferred large kibble over small</a></strong> or medium-sized pieces, so you don’t need to restrict your dog food selection to small kibble sizes.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h3>What is different about large breed dog food?</h3>
    <p>Choosing the best large breed dog food can make an enormous difference in the health of your dog, especially puppies. <strong>Dog foods</strong> designed <strong>for large dogs focus on bone development that’s necessary to support their weight</strong>. Feeding your dog with the  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1604770">wrong type of food could lead to permanent bone damage</a>, including a crippling form of hip dysplasia.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h3>What is the cheapest but best dog food?</h3>
    <p>It’s generally not a good idea to go for the cheapest dog food, but <strong>with research and a lot of experiments, it’s possible to find a good dog food that’s 30% cheaper</strong> than the expensive alternative.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h3>Is organic dog food better?</h3>
    <p>With the <strong>USDA organic label</strong>, your <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/organic/labeling">dog food is certified</a> to be free of antibiotics, synthetic hormones, toxic pesticides, and preservatives. Per the certification, <strong>its ingredients can’t be genetically engineered, grown in chemical fertilizer, or irradiated</strong>.</p>

I use a combination of Beef and Lamb kibble as it is interchangeable. I cannot complain about this company.

        <h3>Best for Puppy</h3>
        <h4>Orijen Puppy Food</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First three ingredients:</strong> Deboned Chicken, Deboned Turkey, Founder</li>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Grain-Free</li>
            <!--    <li><strong>Other recipes:</strong> Beef, Duck & Salmon, Pork, Lamb, Sardine, Turkey</li>-->
            <li><strong>Breed size:</strong> All breed sizes</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestage:</strong> Puppy</li>
            <li><strong>Buy from:</strong> <a href="https://www.chewy.com/orijen-puppy-grain-free-dry-puppy/dp/128810">Chewy</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This food is manufactured in the USA. The food is packed with protein from ingredients that your puppy is
            supposed to eat. It contains 85% poultry and fish ingredients, which are naturally rich in essential
            protein, vitamins, and minerals. This Orijen formula takes the dominant part of the animal protein from
            fresh poultry (chicken and turkey) and fish.</p>
        <p>The recipe contains 38% protein, 20% fat, and 6% crude fibers.</p>

        <aside class="light-box">
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Review</span>: I switched my labradoodle puppy to Orijen puppy when we
                got her at 9 weeks old. We were planning to slowly migrate her over to this, but as soon as we mixed it
                into her food from the breeder, she wouldn't eat the old food anymore - she only wanted Orijen. She
                transitioned very easily and had no issues with her stool. This food is made of the very best
                ingredients - I couldn't wait to feed this to my pup. The kibble is also the right size for a puppy -
                it's smaller than regular adult size kibble which is another reason I think she likes it. It's got a
                moderately strong odor, but not bad. I fully plan to switch to an adult brand for Orijen as soon as my
                puppy comes of age. This is the highest quality dog food in the market - bar none.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Review</span>: I have a mixed breed 3-year-old dog who is a very picky
                eater. I have tried many types of dog food, dry and canned, but she wasn't thrilled with any of them.
                When I first gave her Canidae Grain Free Pure Limited Ingredient Salmon and Sweet Potato Recipe Dry Dog

                NVI wet food is one I chose to feed as I have never been disappointed in NV quality. The ingredients are
                good and there are no fillers or unwanted surprises in the foods. I feed all the varieties with
                something different at each meal. The food smells enticing and those doggy noses get a great workout
                sniffing the air waiting for dinner. The wet foods work great for mixing with kibble or feeding by
                themselves. It is easy to digest and my dogs love mealtime. I will continue to buy the Beef as it is a

        <p>The number one ingredient in this high protein, limited carbohydrate, and low fiber all life stage dog food

                grateful to have found such a perfect formula amongst a sea of really bad dog food. If your pet has a
                small mouth, you can always break it down in a blender or a bag/hammer. Give it try!</p>

                soft poo and diarrhea. While we transitioned him to the new food, the vet sent us home with a bag of this,
                AKA "bland diet," which they said is much better than white rice and boiled chicken. My pup gobbled it
                right up and within 24 hours, his poop was less runny and after 48 hours, it was firm again. We don't
                use this as daily/regular food, but for treating bouts of the upset belly, it works for us. If this sounds
                like your dog, I would also recommend a daily probiotic packet, which we sprinkle over Ned's breakfast
                kibble. That alone has meant we rarely need this Royal Canin. Our vet swears by this brand and I'm
                grateful we have it as a back-up!</p>
